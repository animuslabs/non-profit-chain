Below is a complete list of all protocol features available for activation in the latest **Antelope Spring 1.0** blockchain software (generic reference implementation). Each feature includes its human-readable name, the activation hash (feature digest), and a brief description of its purpose:

- **PREACTIVATE_FEATURE** (`0ec7e080177b2c02b278d5088611686b49d739925a92d9bfcacd7fc6b74053bd`): Enables the **pre-activation** of protocol features. This special consensus upgrade (introduced in EOSIO 1.8) allows a privileged contract (e.g. `eosio.boot`) to activate new protocol features by digest **without a hard fork**. It must be activated **before** any other protocol feature can be used ([spring/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py at main · AntelopeIO/spring · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring/blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py#:~:text=,first%20require%20a%20special%20protocol)) ([spring/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py at main · AntelopeIO/spring · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring/blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py#:~:text=retry%28%27curl%20,http_port)).

- **ACTION_RETURN_VALUE** (`c3a6138c5061cf291310887c0b5c71fcaffeab90d5deb50d3b9e687cead45071`): Allows smart contract actions to return a value to external clients or calling contracts. When activated, a new intrinsic (`set_action_return_value`) is available so that action results are committed in the blockchain (included in action traces and receipts) and can be retrieved without relying on table reads or console output ([Releases · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/eosio/eos/releases#:~:text=New%20protocol%20feature%3A%20,example%20can%20be%20seen%20here)). This streamlines dApp development by enabling direct use of action return values.

- **CONFIGURABLE_WASM_LIMITS2** (`d528b9f6e9693f45ed277af93474fd473ce7d831dae2180cca35d907bd10cb40`): An upgraded version of the Configurable WASM Limits feature. When activated, it allows privileged contracts (e.g. system contract) to **adjust the WebAssembly execution limits** (such as maximum code size, stack usage, etc.) via on-chain configuration ([Releases · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/eosio/eos/releases#:~:text=Configurable%20WASM%20Limits%20%28)) ([Releases · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/eosio/eos/releases#:~:text=New%20protocol%20feature%3A%20,the%20constraints%20on%20WebAssembly%20code)). *Version 2* extends the original EOSIO 2.1 feature to support additional constraints and flexibility in raising WASM resource limits.

- **BLOCKCHAIN_PARAMETERS** (`5443fcf88330c586bc0e5f3dee10e7f63c76c00249c87fe4fbf7f38c082006b4`): Introduces **extensible blockchain parameters** that supplant the old `get_blockchain_parameters_packed` / `set_blockchain_parameters_packed` intrinsics. When activated, this feature allows the system contract to use new intrinsics to get/set chain configuration in a more flexible, versioned way ([Releases · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/eosio/eos/releases#:~:text=The%20basic%20means%20of%20manipulating,add%2Fremove%2Fmodify%20in%20future%20consensus%20upgrades)). It lays groundwork for adding or modifying consensus parameters in future upgrades without hard forks.

- **GET_SENDER** (`f0af56d2c5a48d60a4a5b5c903edfb7db3a736a94ed589d0b797df33ff9d3e1d`): Allows a contract to determine **who sent an inline action** to it. Activating this adds the intrinsic `get_sender()`, which returns the account name of the sender of the current inline action (or 0 if none) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to get the sending account of an inline action · Issue #7028 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/7028#:~:text=Consensus%20protocol%20upgrade%20feature)). This helps contracts authenticate the origin of notifications or actions that have empty authorization (solving a potential spoofing issue) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to get the sending account of an inline action · Issue #7028 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/7028#:~:text=A%20contract%20may%20wish%20to,be%20from%20some%20other%20contract)) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to get the sending account of an inline action · Issue #7028 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/7028#:~:text=Consensus%20protocol%20upgrade%20feature)).

- **FORWARD_SETCODE** (`2652f5f96006294109b3dd0bbde63693f55324af452b799ee137a81a905eed25`): Fixes a bug in the `eosio::setcode` processing logic to allow WebAssembly code on the `eosio` account to execute during a setcode action. With this feature, if an `eosio::setcode` action is setting a new contract on an account that already has a contract, the existing contract’s code will run (allowing pre-checks or migrations) as part of the setcode transaction ([Consensus protocol upgrade to forward setcode actions to the contract on the eosio account · Issue #6988 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6988#:~:text=This%20protocol%20feature%20%28codename%3A%20,actions)). In short, it **forwards `setcode` actions** to the contract’s code on the target account (including `eosio` itself) so that on-chain code can manage code updates ([Consensus protocol upgrade to forward setcode actions to the contract on the eosio account · Issue #6988 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6988#:~:text=This%20protocol%20feature%20%28codename%3A%20,actions)).

- **ONLY_BILL_FIRST_AUTHORIZER** (`8ba52fe7a3956c5cd3a656a3174b931d3bb2abb45578befc59f283ecd816a405`): Changes CPU and NET billing behavior to **charge only the first authorizer** of a transaction, instead of all authorizing accounts. With this activated, the first account in the transaction’s auth list pays the CPU/NET costs for the whole transaction ([Consensus upgrade to only bill CPU and network bandwidth to first authorizer of a transaction · Issue #6332 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6332#:~:text=Currently%2C%20the%20set%20of%20all,billed%20once%20to%20some%20account)) ([Consensus upgrade to only bill CPU and network bandwidth to first authorizer of a transaction · Issue #6332 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6332#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,to%20bill%20the%20desired%20account)). This enables dApps or designated payer accounts to cover users’ bandwidth costs by placing themselves as the first authorizer, facilitating new resource-payment models (e.g. dApp can pay for its users) ([Consensus upgrade to only bill CPU and network bandwidth to first authorizer of a transaction · Issue #6332 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6332#:~:text=By%20only%20billing%20one%20of,for%20some%20form%20of%20compensation)) ([Consensus upgrade to only bill CPU and network bandwidth to first authorizer of a transaction · Issue #6332 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6332#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,to%20bill%20the%20desired%20account)).

- **RESTRICT_ACTION_TO_SELF** (`ad9e3d8f650687709fd68f4b90b41f7d825a365b02c23a636cef88ac2ac00c43`): Removes a historical authorization bypass that applied when contracts send actions to themselves. Before, an inline action or deferred transaction that targeted the same contract account could bypass certain auth checks (a feature deprecated since EOSIO 1.5.1). This upgrade **removes that bypass**, making authorization checking uniform whether an action is self-sent or not ([Consensus protocol upgrade to restrict authorization checking when sending actions to self · Issue #6705 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6705#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,actions%20sent%20by%20a%20contract)). It closes a privilege-escalation vulnerability where a contract could bill RAM/CPU to arbitrary accounts by exploiting the bypass ([Consensus protocol upgrade to restrict authorization checking when sending actions to self · Issue #6705 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6705#:~:text=However%2C%20this%20analysis%20missed%20the,in%20this%20process%20at%20all)) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to restrict authorization checking when sending actions to self · Issue #6705 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6705#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,actions%20sent%20by%20a%20contract)).

- **DISALLOW_EMPTY_PRODUCER_SCHEDULE** (`68dcaa34c0517d19666e6b33add67351d8c5f69e999ca1e37931bc410a297428`): Prohibits proposing an **empty block producer schedule** via the `set_proposed_producers` intrinsic. Without this, a bug allowed a privileged contract to set an empty producer schedule (which would never promote to active, but was unintended) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to disallow proposing an empty producer schedule · Issue #6458 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6458#:~:text=The%20privileged%20,producer%20schedule%20is%20not%20empty)) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to disallow proposing an empty producer schedule · Issue #6458 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6458#:~:text=Analysis%20has%20shown%20that%20actually,in%20schedule%20versions%20for%20the)). This feature simply **blocks empty schedules** from being proposed, avoiding any confusion or edge cases in schedule versioning ([Consensus protocol upgrade to disallow proposing an empty producer schedule · Issue #6458 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6458#:~:text=The%20privileged%20,producer%20schedule%20is%20not%20empty)) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to disallow proposing an empty producer schedule · Issue #6458 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6458#:~:text=Analysis%20has%20shown%20that%20actually,Furthermore%2C%20proposing%20an%20empty)).

- **FIX_LINKAUTH_RESTRICTION** (`e0fb64b1085cc5538970158d05a009c24e276fb94e1a0bf6a528b48fbc4ff526`): Fixes an excessive restriction in the `eosio::linkauth` logic. Due to a bug, any action named `updateauth`, `deleteauth`, `linkauth`, `unlinkauth`, or `canceldelay` (even in a user’s custom contract) was prevented from being linked to a custom permission ([Consensus protocol upgrade to fix excessive restrictions of eosio::linkauth · Issue #6672 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6672#:~:text=To%20preserve%20the%20security%20properties,6654)). This feature corrects that by ensuring the restriction applies **only to the system `eosio` account’s own actions**. After activation, contracts can safely use those action names, and `linkauth` will only forbid linking the five special native actions of the `eosio` system account (and not misapply to others) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to fix excessive restrictions of eosio::linkauth · Issue #6672 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6672#:~:text=To%20preserve%20the%20security%20properties,6654)) ([Consensus protocol upgrade to fix excessive restrictions of eosio::linkauth · Issue #6672 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6672#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,and%20only%20those%20five%20actions)).

- **REPLACE_DEFERRED** (`ef43112c6543b88db2283a2e077278c315ae2c84719a8b25f25cc88565fbea99`): Resolves issues with replacing deferred transactions. It fixes two bugs: (1) when a deferred transaction was replaced by a new one with the same `sender_id`, the RAM paid for the old one was not refunded; (2) the transaction ID of the replaced deferred transaction was not updated, potentially causing duplicate IDs in history ([Consensus upgrade to fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactions · Issue #6103 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6103#:~:text=The%20bug%20involved%20two%20distinct,of%20the%20new%20deferred%20transaction)) ([Consensus upgrade to fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactions · Issue #6103 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6103#:~:text=The%20second%20oversight%20can%20lead,retiring%20deferred%20transactions%20in%20a)). Activating this feature officially **allows deferred transactions to be replaced** correctly – it refunds the RAM to the original payer and ensures the new deferred transaction gets a proper unique ID going forward ([Consensus upgrade to fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactions · Issue #6103 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6103#:~:text=The%20first%20oversight%20means%20that,upgrade%20proposes%20to%20do%20so)) ([Consensus upgrade to fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactions · Issue #6103 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6103#:~:text=Consensus%20upgrade%20feature)). It also retroactively corrects RAM usage for any accounts affected by the prior bug at the moment of activation ([Consensus upgrade to fix problems associated with replacing deferred transactions · Issue #6103 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6103#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20the%20consensus,been%20affected%20by%20the%20bug)).

- **NO_DUPLICATE_DEFERRED_ID** (`4a90c00d55454dc5b059055ca213579c6ea856967712a56017487886a4d4cc0f`): Ensures that **deferred transaction IDs are unique** and cannot collide. This upgrade adds a mechanism so that a deferred transaction’s generated ID will be virtually impossible to duplicate, even if a contract unintentionally schedules the same deferred transaction multiple times ([Consensus upgrade to avoid transaction ID collision of deferred transactions · Issue #6115 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6115#:~:text=The%20main%20goal%20of%20the,that%20sent%20the%20deferred%20transaction)). It accomplishes this by introducing new transaction extension data (or using a global sequence) such that each deferred transaction’s ID differs even if other fields match ([Consensus upgrade to avoid transaction ID collision of deferred transactions · Issue #6115 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6115#:~:text=The%20main%20goal%20of%20the,that%20sent%20the%20deferred%20transaction)) ([Consensus upgrade to avoid transaction ID collision of deferred transactions · Issue #6115 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6115#:~:text=A%20transaction%20extension%20with%20a,in%20order)). In summary, once activated, no two deferred transactions will share the same transaction ID (and contracts can even predict the IDs deterministically if needed) ([Consensus upgrade to avoid transaction ID collision of deferred transactions · Issue #6115 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6115#:~:text=The%20main%20goal%20of%20the,that%20sent%20the%20deferred%20transaction)).

- **ONLY_LINK_TO_EXISTING_PERMISSION** (`1a99a59d87e06e09ec5b028a9cbb7749b4a5ad8819004365d02dc4379a8b7241`): Fixes a bug in the `eosio::linkauth` action to ensure the target permission **actually exists on the account**. Prior to this, `linkauth` would allow linking an action to a permission name that didn’t exist on that account (if that name existed on *some* account) ([Consensus upgrade to disallow linking to non-existing permission · Issue #6333 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6333#:~:text=The%20,name%20exists%20within%20some%20account)). This feature enforces that the *specified account* has the permission before linking ([Consensus upgrade to disallow linking to non-existing permission · Issue #6333 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6333#:~:text=The%20,name%20exists%20within%20some%20account)) ([Consensus upgrade to disallow linking to non-existing permission · Issue #6333 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6333#:~:text=Consensus%20upgrade%20feature)). (It doesn’t retroactively fix already-broken links, but prevents new ones; linking to a non-existent permission will fail once this is active.)

- **RAM_RESTRICTIONS** (`4e7bf348da00a945489b2a681749eb56f5de00b900014e137ddae39f48f69d67`): Modifies rules around billing RAM usage in contracts. It **disallows unprivileged contracts in notification contexts from increasing another account’s RAM usage** (making permanent the prior subjective mitigation against the notorious RAM exploit) ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,RAM%20to%20achieve%20two%20objectives)) ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=1,additional%20RAM%20without%20their%20authorization)). At the same time, it *allows* certain safe operations that were previously impossible: e.g. moving table rows between accounts without extra auth, as long as the net RAM for each account doesn’t increase ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,RAM%20to%20achieve%20two%20objectives)) ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=1,additional%20RAM%20without%20their%20authorization)). In short, this feature makes the RAM billing rules more strict to prevent abuse (no charging RAM to others unless authorized) but more flexible for legitimate use (permitting row migration when it doesn’t increase usage) ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=The%20goal%20of%20this%20consensus,RAM%20to%20achieve%20two%20objectives)) ([Consensus upgrade to modify the restrictions on RAM billing · Issue #6105 · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/issues/6105#:~:text=obsolete%29%3B%202,additional%20RAM%20without%20their%20authorization)).

- **WEBAUTHN_KEY** (`4fca8bd82bbd181e714e283f83e1b45d95ca5af40fb89ad3977b653c448f78c2`): Enables support for **WebAuthn (FIDO2) keys** as a new signature type on the blockchain. With this activated, the chain recognizes WebAuthn-generated signatures and allows accounts to use WebAuthn public keys for their authorities ([eos/libraries/chain/protocol_feature_manager.cpp at master · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/libraries/chain/protocol_feature_manager.cpp#:~:text=%2F)). (It was introduced to let users authenticate with devices like YubiKeys or biometrics via the WebAuthn standard.)

- **WTMSIG_BLOCK_SIGNATURES** (`299dcb6af692324b899b39f16d5a530a33062804e41f09dc97e9f156b4476707`): Allows block producers to use a **Weighted Threshold Multi-Signature** (WTMsig) authority for signing blocks. In other words, instead of a single private key signing each block, a producer can configure a multi-key authority (with a threshold and weights) as their block signing key. Once this feature is active, the block header format changes to support multiple signatures, and block producers can safely distribute block-signing across multiple keys/devices ([eos/libraries/chain/protocol_feature_manager.cpp at master · EOSIO/eos · GitHub](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/libraries/chain/protocol_feature_manager.cpp#:~:text=Builtin%20protocol%20feature%3A%20WTMSIG_BLOCK_SIGNATURES)). (This was aimed at improving security by allowing redundant or multi-party block signing setups.)

- **GET_CODE_HASH** (`bcd2a26394b36614fd4894241d3c451ab0f6fd110958c3423073621a70826e99`): Provides an intrinsic to retrieve the **code hash of a contract**. When activated, a contract (likely via a new `get_code_hash` intrinsic) can fetch the SHA-256 hash of another account’s deployed WASM code. This enables on-chain logic to verify code identity or ensure an account has a expected code version. (For example, system contracts or inter-blockchain communication contracts might use this to check if a partner contract’s code matches a known hash.)

- **GET_BLOCK_NUM** (`35c2186cc36f7bb4aeaf4487b36e57039ccf45a9136aa856a5d569ecca55ef2b`): Introduces a simple intrinsic that returns the **current block number**. After activation, smart contracts can call `get_block_num()` to obtain the block height in which they are running. This can be useful for time-based logic or generating unique seeds, etc., without relying on block timestamps alone.

- **CRYPTO_PRIMITIVES** (`6bcb40a24e49c26d0a60513b6aeb8551d264e4717f306b81a37a5afb3b47cedc`): Adds a suite of low-level cryptographic intrinsics for advanced operations. Once enabled, developers can include the crypto extensions API (`crypto_ext.hpp`) in contracts ([Crypto Extensions API | EOS Developer Documentation](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/manuals/cdt/latest/features/crypto-extensions/#:~:text=In%20order%20to%20use%20the,command%20in%20your%20command%20line)). It provides functions for elliptic curve operations on the **alt_bn128** curve (the pairing-friendly curve used in Ethereum’s zk-SNARKs), such as `alt_bn128_add`, `alt_bn128_mul`, and `alt_bn128_pair` (pairing check) ([Crypto Extensions API | EOS Developer Documentation](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/manuals/cdt/latest/features/crypto-extensions/#:~:text=Plain%20C%20API)), as well as big integer modular exponentiation (`mod_exp`) and other crypto routines. These primitives allow efficient implementation of complex crypto algorithms (e.g. zk-SNARK verification, RSA ops) inside smart contracts ([Crypto Extensions API | EOS Developer Documentation](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/manuals/cdt/latest/features/crypto-extensions/#:~:text=Plain%20C%20API)) ([Crypto Extensions API | EOS Developer Documentation](https://docs.eosnetwork.com/manuals/cdt/latest/features/crypto-extensions/#:~:text=Optimal,result%2C%20uint32_t)).

- **BLS_PRIMITIVES2** (`63320dd4a58212e4d32d1f58926b73ca33a247326c2a5e9fd39268d2384e011a`): Provides cryptographic support for **BLS signatures** (Boneh–Lynn–Shacham) and is the updated version 2 of this feature. (It supersedes an earlier `BLS_PRIMITIVES` feature with a breaking change in the API.) Activating BLS_PRIMITIVES2 makes new BLS-related host functions available for contracts and the system (used in finality confirmation) ([Releases · AntelopeIO/leap · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/releases#:~:text=Renamed%20,rc2)). BLS signatures allow aggregation (combining multiple signatures into one); this feature is crucial for the Savanna finality mechanism. *Note:* The rename to “2” indicates the interface/behavior was changed from the initial version ([Releases · AntelopeIO/leap · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/leap/releases#:~:text=Renamed%20,rc2)), so all chains moving to Spring should use BLS_PRIMITIVES2.

- **DISABLE_DEFERRED_TRXS_STAGE_1** (`fce57d2331667353a0eac6b4209b67b843a7262a848af0a49a6e2fa9f6584eb4`): Begins the process of deprecating deferred transactions. “Stage 1” when activated will **disallow the scheduling of any new deferred transactions** ([spring/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py at main · AntelopeIO/spring · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring/blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py#:~:text=%23%20DISABLE_DEFERRED_TRXS_STAGE_1%20,DEFERRED%20TRANSACTIONS)). In other words, after this feature, contracts can no longer create (send) deferred transactions at all. (It was the first of a two-step protocol change to gracefully retire deferred transactions from the platform.)

- **DISABLE_DEFERRED_TRXS_STAGE_2** (`09e86cb0accf8d81c9e85d34bea4b925ae936626d00c984e4691186891f5bc16`): The second phase of deferred tx removal. “Stage 2” prevents any already-scheduled deferred transactions from being delivered/executed on other nodes ([spring/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py at main · AntelopeIO/spring · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring/blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py#:~:text=%23%20DISABLE_DEFERRED_TRXS_STAGE_1%20,DEFERRED%20TRANSACTIONS)) ([spring/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py at main · AntelopeIO/spring · GitHub](https://github.com/AntelopeIO/spring/blob/main/tutorials/bios-boot-tutorial/bios-boot-tutorial.py#:~:text=%23%20DISABLE_DEFERRED_TRXS_STAGE_2%20,TRANSACTIONS%20FROM%20REACHING%20OTHER%20NODE)). In effect, once this is activated, **no deferred transactions will run or propagate**. Together, Stage 1 and Stage 2 eliminate deferred transactions entirely (Stage 1 stops new ones; Stage 2 flushes the old ones after they either execute or expire on the originating node only).

- **SAVANNA** (`cbe0fafc8fcc6cc998395e9b6de6ebd94644467b1b4a97ec126005df07013c52`): Activates the new **Savanna consensus algorithm** (also referred to as *instant finality* for Antelope). Once all prior features are enabled and block producers execute a coordinated activation, the chain switches to Savanna, which achieves *~1-second transaction finality*. Savanna leverages aggregated BLS signatures from producers to finalize blocks rapidly ([EOS Network Introduces Savanna Consensus Algorithm](https://u.today/eos-network-introduces-savanna-consensus-algorithm#:~:text=It%20merges%20aggregate%20BLS%20signatures,100x%20improvement%20over%20previous%20releases)). In practice, after `SAVANNA` is activated (and producers call the `switchtosvnn` action), blocks become **irreversible within just two rounds** (effectively one block interval), dramatically improving confirmation time. This consensus upgrade (inspired by HotStuff) brings Web2-level speed to finality on Antelope chains ([EOS Network Introduces Savanna Consensus Algorithm](https://u.today/eos-network-introduces-savanna-consensus-algorithm#:~:text=Leap%206%20introduces%20Instant%20Finality,experience%20to%20the%20Web3%20space)) ([EOS Network Introduces Savanna Consensus Algorithm](https://u.today/eos-network-introduces-savanna-consensus-algorithm#:~:text=It%20merges%20aggregate%20BLS%20signatures,100x%20improvement%20over%20previous%20releases)).
